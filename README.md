DoxygenXCodeHelper
==================

A very basic helper script to make it less onerous to document code in Xcode 5.

Many thanks to Fredd McCann for writing this awesome utility. A slight change was made to support ruby 1.9 as it was breaking for some people.

The original script and more detailed usage information can be found here: http://duckrowing.com/2011/05/14/using-the-doxygen-helper-in-xcode-4/

#### Basic Usage: 

Copy to ~/Library/Services
Assign a keyboard shortcut in system settings.
In XCode, select a method signature and press the assigned keyboard shortcut.
